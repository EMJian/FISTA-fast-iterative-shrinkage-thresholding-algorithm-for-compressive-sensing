Note: This is a TUTORIAL on how to use FISTA for multitude of applications. I used it for efficient data processing of Ultrasound 
Images with savings upto 70%. This code shows how to exploit data redundancy in a brilliant technique. 
If you have any queries, feel free to ask.

Steps:
1. Include the Optimisation folder in the directory
2. Run the mainfunction.m file 
3. You're good to go.

The goal of this project is to form the reconstructed signal that we see using the least number of raw data points. 
The methods used in this regard performs better than conventional solutions in the context of optimisation theory, convergence rate, 
computational complexity.
